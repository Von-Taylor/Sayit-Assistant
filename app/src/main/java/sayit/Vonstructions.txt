Replace file preservation with server
On server:
- Store an ArrayList prompts that will preserve the prompts used in app
- GET: at a given index, return a response in the form <question> + /D\ + <answer>
    - /D\ is a delimeter for the question and answer
- POST: from the input file, read the first line (question), then read the rest of the lines (answer) and store into prompts
- DELETE: at a given index, just delete the question and answer in prompts
