Refactoring to 3-tier architecture:
- move all business logic to server 
    x- bring back file preservation, but do it on the server
    - make different contexts for each functionality (different requestHandler for each)
        x- /loadPrompts
        x- /newQuestion 
        x- /deletePrompt
        x- /clearAll
        - /createEmail
        - /sendEmail
x- make UI only show buttons, and prompts retreived from server
    x- should no longer store anything 
    x- buttons/functionalities should just be: 
        x- making a request (which changes the prompts on the server) 
        x- receving back a string response (used to update the UI)
x- Only App, AppFrame, Footer, and ScrollFrame are needed for UI
x- Rest of the classes should be doing stuff on the server


In AppFrame:
x- put the JPanels (scrollFrame, Footer) in
x- in addListeners()
    x- newButton: 
        x- if not recording, request server to begin creating the wav file on its side
        x- if is recording, request server to finalize wav file, input it into whisper, save the Q&A into its prompts, then return them back in response string
            x- extract the Q&A from response string and add them to scrollFrame
    x- clearButton:
        x- clear out the scrollFrame
        x- request server to clear its prompts
    x- clearSelectedButton:
        x- clear the selected prompts in scrollFrame, but make sure to keep an ArrayList of the indices of the prompts deleted
        x- iterate through those indices and request server to delete whatever prompt at that index
    x- addWindowListener:
        x- request server to write all its prompts into a preserve.txt file
    x- AppFrame constructor:
        x- request server for all prompts in its preserve.txt file
            x- add all of these prompts to scrollFrame


In ServerTest:
    x- Create tests for loadPromptsHandler:
        x- Test "GET": returns the correct Q&A at given index
    x- Create tests for newQuestionHandler:
        x- Test "GET": returns Q&A received from (mocked) ChatGPT
        x- Test "POST": check that it adds a Q&A into its prompts correctly
    x- Create tests for deletePromptHandler:
        x- Test "DELETE": check the size, and that the expected Q&A's that weren't deleted are still there
    x- Create tests for clearAllHandler:
        x- Test "DELETE": check the size, and that the first element doesn't exist


In FilePreservationTest:
    x- Create tests for loadPromptsHandler:
        x- Test "PUT": the beforePrompts matches with what is read into afterPrompts from the .txt file


In startHandler:
    x- For "GET": 
        x- when requested to start, record audio
        x- when requested to stop, get only the transcription of the question/prompt from ChatGPT (not an answer)
    x- Mock it


In newQuestionHandler (update):
    x- In "GET":
        x- change functionality to instead just take in a question (read from inputted file) rather than creating it with InputQ
        x- the rest is the same where it just gets an answer for it, adds it to prompts, and sends a response with the Q&A
    x- Remove IAudioRecord and InputQ (only need OutputA)
    x- Fix mocking


In AppFrame addListeners:
    x- make Start button request startHandler "GET" to start and stop recording
    - when stop recording, read back response, parse it, then call correct function with it
        - if the first 2 or 1 words are "new question" or "question", call newQuestion(String question) and pass in the question portion from the response
            x- requests newQuestionHandler with the question
        - if the first 2 words are "clear all", call clearAll()
            x- requests clearAllHandler to clear all prompts
        - if the first 2 words are "delete prompt", call clearSelected()
            x- requests deletePromptHandler to delete the selected prompts
